IMMEDIATE:

	+ Stgy
		- Run AggSar search on existing blngr band stgys
		- StmCnd: Intersection: stm values intersecting each cnd tme
		- StmCnd: Intersection Rng: Cross section range detection using distance algorithm

	+Plt (Search for quality entries)
		- Cross Section plot of stm values intersecting all cnd tmes
		- Histogram of stream at all Cnd tmes
			- Cnd refinement/development using histogram binning across pll stm features
		- Rng plt centered at single tme (Cnd tme)
		- Vertical stack of Rng plts center-aligned at each Cnd tme (allows for feature detection)

	+ Instr
		- Add minor currencies to tic intake
	+ Rlt:
		- record trade data
			- what strategy is used; trade strat stats; want to know expectation
			- record Oanda trade id
			- record to cld table
			- TrdClsReason enum

	+ Prd:
		- Place ana.Instr stats in cld to allow retrieve spread threshold without local db
		- Consider how to have the analytics engine always running in background and restarted if rebooted
		- Use Stackdriver logging/tracing for prd deployment

	+ StgyPrfm
		- Develop confidence factor blend
			- Highest ScsPct
			- Highest RevMin
			- Lowest LosLim
			- Lowest DurMdn

	+ Cnd
		- Or: same as Stgy Cnds. Use a tmeLim for cnd delivery. Or is ANY within 2s
			- Variadic cnds
			- Deliver TmeLim
		- And
			- Change to variadic cnds
			- Add Deliver TmeLim. It is different than Seq. And is Pll, Seq is sequential 2s then 2s. And is all within 2s
		
	+ Scp: revise scp approach
		- existing: asn, acs, each, eachPll, then, else
		- sel on arr: same as where, make pll in implementation
		- ari: in-place on scp: inc, dec, addBy, subBy, mulBy, divBy
		- ari atm: in-place on scp: atmInc, atmDec, atmAddBy, atmSubBy, atmMulBy, divBy

	+ Portfolio: optimization search

	+ Regime charaterization by one or more stream features within a time range
		- Regime characterization search
		- Regime portfolio: load Stgies appearing in hst regime
		- Regime portfolio optimization
	+ Rlt regime detection/matching. What regime are we in?
		- Create realtime regime portfolio: load all stgies for each realtime regime (hour, day, week, etc...)
		- Optimize realtime regime portfolio
		- Trade optimized realtime regime portfolio

	+ Portfolio: slice of profitable stgies with a performance
		- Calculate portfolio performance
	+ PrtRng: create
	+ Hst Tme Fltr: ana.oan().hst(2018-4-1 2018-5-1).audUsd(); prm variadic?, rlt symmetric
	+ Obj interface: String() method, all objects
	+ pro/lng: in-lang logging
	+ Vscode: prolang color support
	+ VsCode: Intellisense

	+ Test
		- Stms: rlt stmsMnr
		- Cnds: rlt cndsMnr
		
	+ Sys
		- Cross instrument usage
		- Tme/Val interpolation
		- Stm
		- Cnd
		- Strat
	+ Log
		- in-language logging

	+ Rlt:
		- consider how to clear out rlt stm data; on weekend? memory consumption on machine will overflow if not trimmed at some point
		- rlt tkr to monitor when to clear rlt data after week?
		- rlt.cls() method to close out all realtime stgys
		- rlt.opn(): load and process hst data into rlt graph for current moment?
	+ Account:
		- consider how to specify different accounts
			- live vs practive
			- different people

	+ Plt
		- Legend for stm with coloir and name
	+ Tkr
	- tme.Tkr: scp function calling (for periodic stgy cloud saves)

	+Inrvl
		- Store InrvlBnds in prv.Stm; no need to recompute more than once for hst and rlt?

Vis:
	Plt:

SrchLong:
	+ Pre-Count calculation

Prolang:
+ Var: Change IsSingle to var usage 
	# enables logging from anywhere
	# enabled 
	- Cor
	- Ana
+	Trds Fld to Tbl column mapping
+	Trds .showTbl()
+	Trds Whr<prop>
+	Trds Srt<prop>(Asc|Dsc)

ProBox:
	+ Table
	+ Taber (support Multiple Table, Histogram etc)
	+ ProgressBar
	

	+ Test
		- Variadic parameter generation for 0, 1, 3 arguments. Support ana fns
		- Stgy: need different cnd in variadic parameters for th
		- Oan: Setup mock endpoints to mimic real trades with server

	+ Tme
		- Change Date literal?
			- 2017y11m12dT23h37m2s
			- 2017-11-12/23-34-56
			- 2017-11-12/23h34m56s
